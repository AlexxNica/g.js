Create a string value that can be used as a variable.

This function just returns the input value:

    g.string('Hello');

By itself this seems rather silly, but in networks, this becomes a useful node because it can be used as a *variable*. You can use it to store a number that you use in several places in your network, for example the size of the composition.
