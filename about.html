  <p>The goal of g.js is to be a fast, complete library for doing graphics processing in JavaScript. We provide support for vector graphics and images, as well as more primitive operations such as linear interpolation, color blending, and math and list operations.</p>

   <p>g.js was created by <a href="https://www.emrg.be/">EMRG</a>, the Experimental Media Research Group. Our mission is to promote the computer from a production tool to a creative partner. We release a number of open-source tools, most notably <a href="https://www.nodebox.net/">NodeBox</a>, <a href="http://www.clips.ua.ac.be/pattern">Pattern</a>, and <a href="http://opentype.js.org/">OpenType.js</a>.</p>

  <p>If you're using g.js in academic works, we prefer you would cite it like this: <cite>Based on: canvas.js, https://github.com/clips/pattern/blob/master/pattern/canvas.js (BSD). De Smedt T. &amp; Daelemans W. (2012). Pattern for Python. Journal of Machine Learning Research.</cite></p>
