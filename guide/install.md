g.js plays nicely with build frameworks like npm and Bower. In addition, you can also just use the library directly.

## Directly
[Download the latest ZIP](https://github.com/nodebox/g.js/archive/master.zip) and grab the files in the `dist` folder. These are compiled for the latest release of g.js. These files contain all necessary dependencies.

## Using a CDN
g.js can be served from the [RawGit](http://rawgit.com/) content delivery network (CDN). Just include the following line in your HTML file:

    <script src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/nodebox/g.js/master/dist/g.min.js"></script>

## Using Bower

To install using [Bower](http://bower.io/), enter the following command in your project directory:

    bower install g.js

You can then include them in your scripts using:

    <script src="/bower_components/g.js/dist/g.js"></script>

## Using npm / Browserify

To install using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), enter the following command in your project directory:

    npm install --save g.js
