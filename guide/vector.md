NodeBox Live has great support for working with vector shapes such as paths, text, lines and points.

### Basic Shapes

[rect](../ref/rect.html) / [ellipse](../ref/ellipse.html) / [polygon](../ref/polygon.html) / [arc](../ref/arc.html) / [star](../ref/star.html)

[line](../ref/line.html) — a line between two points

[lineAngle](../ref/lineAngle.html) — a line with a starting point and an angle / distance

[quadCurve](../ref/quadCurve.html) — smooth quadratic bézier curve

### Text

[text](../ref/text.html) — basic text

[textPath](../ref/textPath.html) — text as a path object that can be manipulated

### Grids

[grid](../ref/grid.html) — a rectangular grid of points

### Transforming Shapes

[align](../ref/align.html) — align shapes in relation to the origin

[delete](../ref/delete.html) — delete points or sub-paths in a shape

[fit](../ref/fit.html) — resize shapes to fit given size

[reflect](../ref/reflect.html) — mirror shapes

[translate](../ref/translate.html) / [rotate](../ref/rotate.html) / [scale](../ref/scale.html) / [skew](../ref/skew.html)

### Distorting Shapes

[resample](../ref/resample.html) — distribute points along the shape

[snap](../ref/snap.html) — align points of the shape to an invisible grid

[wiggle](../ref/wiggle.html) — randomly shift the points of a shape

### Combining Shapes

[merge](../ref/merge.html) — combine multiple shapes into one

[compound](../ref/compound.html) — add, subtract or intersect shapes

[copy](../ref/copy.html) — make transformed copies

[fitTo](../ref/fitTo.html) — fit a shape within the bounds of another shape

[group](../ref/group.html) / [ungroup](../ref/ungroup.html)

[link](../ref/link.html) — visually link two shapes together

[shapeOnPath](../ref/shapeOnPath.html) — place shapes on a curve

[stack](../ref/stack.html) — arrange shapes horizontally or vertically

[sort](../ref/sort.html) — sort points/shapes by position or distance

### Points

[makePoint](../ref/makePoint.html) — using X/Y coordinates

[toPoints](../ref/toPoints.html) — extract points from the shape

[connect](../ref/connect.html) — make a polygon from a list of points

[scatter](../ref/scatter.html) — randomly place points within the shape

### Color

[colorize](../ref/colorize.html) — set the color of the shape

[colorLookup](../ref/colorLookup.html) — lookup a color component

[rgbColor](../ref/rgb.html) / [hsbColor](../ref/hsb.html) / [grayColor](../ref/gray.html)

### Geometry

[bounds](../ref/bounds.html) — calculate the bounding box

[centroid](../ref/centroid.html) — calculate the geometric center

[coordinates](../ref/coordinates.html) — generate point based on distance / angle

[pointOnPath](../ref/pointOnPath.html) — calculate a point on the path

[angle](../ref/angle.html) / [distance](../ref/distance.html)

### Importing Shapes

[import](../ref/import.html) — import SVG files
