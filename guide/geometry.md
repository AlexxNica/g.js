Mathematical operations with points.

### Creating points

[makePoint](../ref/makePoint.html) — make a point based on X/Y values.

### Calculations on points

[angle](../ref/angle.html) — calculate an angle between two points.

[coordinates](../ref/coordinates.html) — calculate a point based on another point.

[distance](../ref/distance.html) — calculate the distance between two points.

[reflect](../ref/reflect.html) — reflect a point over an axis.

### Geometric queries

[bounds](../ref/bounds.html) — give the bounds of the shape.

[centroid](../ref/centroid.html) — calculate the geometric center of the shape.

### Shape to points

[scatter](../ref/scatter.html) — scatter points within a shape.

[toPoints](../ref/toPoints.html) — give the points that make up a shape.

[resample](../ref/resample.html) — calculate new points on the shape.

[pointOnPath](../ref/pointOnPath.html) — calculate a point on a path.
